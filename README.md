Source of dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/pmigdal/alien-vs-predator-images

The model training is not based on any pre-trained models. It was aimed to play with hyperparameter tunings to find out in a practical way, which hyperparameters have what kind of impact on the model performance. The selection of a proper model architecture is also involved and considered in the experiments.

The binary classification task is separated into two notebooks: One for the model training, another one for the model evaluation. The result consists of two trained models.

Model 1:<br>
Training loss: 0.076844<br>
Training accuracy: 0.989914<br>
Validation loss: 0.540033<br>
Validation accuracy: **0.855000**<br>

Model 2:<br>
Training loss: 0.219322<br>
Training accuracy: 0.940922<br>
Validation loss: 0.441823<br>
Validation accuracy: **0.860000**<br>
