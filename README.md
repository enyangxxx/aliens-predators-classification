Source of dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/pmigdal/alien-vs-predator-images

The model training is not based on any pre-trained models. It was aimed to play with hyperparameter tunings to find out in a practical way, which hyperparameters have what kind of impact on the model performance. The selection of a proper model architecture is also involved and considered in the experiments.

The binary classification task is separated into two notebooks: One for the model training, another one for the model evaluation. The result consists of two trained models.

Model 1:
Training loss: 0.076844
Training accuracy: 0.989914
Validation loss: 0.540033
Validation accuracy: **0.855000**

Model 2:
Training loss: 0.219322
Training accuracy: 0.940922
Validation loss: 0.441823
Validation accuracy: **0.860000**
